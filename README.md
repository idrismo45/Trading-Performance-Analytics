Trading Performance Analysis Dashboard

Overview:

This project involves creating a detailed breakdown analysis of a client's trading performance over a six-month period. The analysis includes various key metrics and visualisations to provide actionable insights into the trading activities.

Objective:

A client requested an in-depth analysis of their trading performance from September 2023 to March 2024. This was my first attempt at conducting such an analysis, and the goal was to present the findings in an intuitive and comprehensive manner.

Key Features:

Cumulative Balance Analysis: Displays the account's balance growth over the amount of trades in that time period.
Net Profit per Symbol: Highlights the profitability of different trading symbols.
Trading Session Performance: Shows performance during different trading sessions (New York, London, and Out of Session).
Key Metrics: Provides essential statistics such as total P&L, total trades, win rate, average RR ratio, percentage growth, and most traded day.
Additional Key Metrics: Includes the most traded pair, average trade duration, maximum drawdown, average win, and average loss.
Insights and Advice: Offers recommendations based on the analysis, including best and worst trading pairs and sessions, and potential savings by avoiding out-of-session trades.
